== Description ==
This plugin shows Google PageSpeed scores for the themes installed from the official WordPress theme repository.
With this you can easily determine which themes are fast and which ones can slow down your WordPress blog when used.

Plugin shows 2 scores (see screenshot):

* Google PageSpeed score for blogs' Home page
* Google PageSpeed score for blogs' sample Post page
